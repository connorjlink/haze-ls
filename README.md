# Haze Language Server

A context-sensitive LSP-compliant language server implementation for my custom programming language, Haze. Also includes a simple TextMate grammar specification designed for VSCode and Visual Studio 2022.

Once I'm satisfied with the functionality, I'll freeze a language server .exe and bundle a VSIX for release on the Visual Studio 2022 marketplace.
